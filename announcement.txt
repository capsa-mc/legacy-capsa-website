With the increased cases of COVID-19 in Maryland, CAPSA has decided to suspend our tutoring program at Robert Frost Middle School effective immediately. At this time, we plan to resume the program on Saturday, April 18th.  We will continue to monitor the situation and take further actions if necessary.  

In the meantime, CAPSA would like to offer remote learning opportunities. CAPSA will approve up to four SSL hours per week for tutors who provided remote learning. The remote learning is strictly voluntary, and the tutoring session timing is subject to the mutual agreement between the tutor and the tutee. Interested tutees should email your coordinators (You can find your coordinator email address on our website) asking for matching. Please note CAPSA cannot guarantee the availability of any tutor. In order to earn the SSL hours, on a weekly basis tutors must email their lead coordinator with the following information:

-	Date, time, and length of time of the tutoring session(s) conducted
-	Verification from the tutee’s parent or legal guardian on the above information (this can be an email from the parent or legal guardian attached to the tutor’s request)
 

对于马里兰州日益严重的COVID-19疫情，为谨慎起见，CAPSA决定暂停Robert Frost中学的课业辅导计划。我们暂时计划于4/18/2020恢复课业辅导，但我们会根据日后情况持续评估。
同时， CAPSA将推出远程课业辅导，并授予小老师每周最多4小时的SSL时间。远程课业辅导仅限于学生和小老师双方同意。有需要的学生可与你们的协调员联系。他们的邮件可在我们的网站找到。 由于家庭状况不同，CAPSA不能确保每个小老师都能远程提供辅导。 小老师如果想登记SSL时间，请电邮你的首席协调员，包括以下信息： 日期，辅导时长，附上和学生家长或者监护人的电邮通讯作为证明。
