With the increased cases of COVID-19 in Maryland, CAPSA has decided to suspend our tutoring program at Robert Frost Middle School effective immediately. At this time, we plan to resume the program on Saturday, April 18th.  We will continue to monitor the situation and take further actions if necessary.  

In the meantime, CAPSA would like to offer remote learning opportunities. The remote learning is strictly voluntary, and the tutoring session timing is subject to the mutual agreement between the tutor and the tutee. Interested tutees should email your coordinators (You can find your coordinator email address on our website) asking for matching. Please note CAPSA cannot guarantee the availability of any tutor. According to MCPS guideline, we cannot offer SSL hour for the remote tutoring.
 

对于马里兰州日益严重的COVID-19疫情，为谨慎起见，CAPSA决定暂停Robert Frost中学的课业辅导计划。我们暂时计划于4/18/2020恢复课业辅导，但我们会根据日后情况持续评估。
同时， CAPSA将推出远程课业辅导，远程课业辅导仅限于学生和小老师双方同意。有需要的学生可与你们的协调员联系。他们的邮件可在我们的网站找到。 由于家庭状况不同，CAPSA不能确保每个小老师都能远程提供辅导。 根据MCPS给出的指导，我们不能为远程辅导提供SSL小时。
